# Stellacare Multi-Year Healthcare Report

## 📊 Project Overview

The **Stellacare Multi-Year Healthcare Report** is an analytical project that explores patient-level healthcare data collected over several years from the Stellacare health network. Leveraging Microsoft Excel and Pivot Table techniques, the project analyzes billing records, diagnoses, test results, hospital statistics, insurance distributions, and demographic variables to uncover patterns and generate strategic healthcare insights.

### 🎯 Key Objectives

- Identify high-billing patients and institutions  
- Highlight the most frequent and most expensive medical conditions  
- Evaluate test result trends and consistency  
- Assess insurance provider distribution and concentration  
- Reveal blood type and demographic prevalence  
- Provide insights and recommendations to improve service delivery, cost-efficiency, and patient outcomes

## 🔍 Observations & Insights

- **Billing Patterns:**  
  Top patients averaged around **$52,000** in billing, with **Todd Carrillo** reaching the highest at **$52,764** — indicating consistent high-cost care.

- **Condition Frequency vs. Cost:**  
  **Arthritis (9,308 cases)** was the most frequent condition, but **Obesity ($25,806 average)** was the most expensive. Frequency does not necessarily align with treatment cost.

- **Cancer Treatment:**  
  Despite being the **least costly on average ($25,162)**, **cancer** remained among the top conditions in frequency — possibly reflecting high efficiency or optimized oncology protocols.

- **Test Results:**  
  The dataset shows nearly equal distribution of test results: **Abnormal (18,627)**, **Normal (18,517)**, and **Inconclusive (18,356)** — suggesting diagnostic variability or ambiguity.

- **Insurance Spread:**  
  Insurance was distributed almost evenly across providers, with **Cigna** slightly leading at **11,249** cases — pointing to a competitive insurance market.

- **Hospital Billing:**  
  Average billing among top hospitals ranged narrowly between **$51,976 and $52,373**, indicating standardized billing procedures.

- **Blood Type Distribution:**  
  All blood types appeared relatively balanced, with **A- (6,969)** being the most common — suggesting a genetically diverse patient base with no significant outliers.

## ✅ Recommendations

- Implement **cost-efficiency programs** for obesity-related treatments, which have the highest average billing.  
- Prioritize **early diagnosis and chronic care management** for arthritis and diabetes.  
- Review and improve **diagnostic accuracy** due to high inconclusive result rates.  
- Leverage **insurance provider balance** to renegotiate better terms.  
- Maintain **standardized billing** while incorporating performance-based assessments.  
- Adapt **oncology cost-efficiency strategies** for other high-expense conditions.  
- Use **blood type and demographic insights** in personalized medicine planning.
