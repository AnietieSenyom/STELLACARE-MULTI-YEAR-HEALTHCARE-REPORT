# Stellacare Multi-Year Healthcare Report

## üìä Project Overview

The **Stellacare Multi-Year Healthcare Report** is an analytical project that explores patient-level healthcare data collected over several years from the Stellacare health network. Leveraging Microsoft Excel and Pivot Table techniques, the project analyzes billing records, diagnoses, test results, hospital statistics, insurance distributions, and demographic variables to uncover patterns and generate strategic healthcare insights.

### üéØ Key Objectives

- Identify high-billing patients and institutions  
- Highlight the most frequent and most expensive medical conditions  
- Evaluate test result trends and consistency  
- Assess insurance provider distribution and concentration  
- Reveal blood type and demographic prevalence  
- Provide insights and recommendations to improve service delivery, cost-efficiency, and patient outcomes

## üîç Observations & Insights

- **Billing Patterns:**  
  Top patients averaged around **$52,000** in billing, with **Todd Carrillo** reaching the highest at **$52,764** ‚Äî indicating consistent high-cost care.

- **Condition Frequency vs. Cost:**  
  **Arthritis (9308 cases)** was the most frequent condition, but **Obesity ($25,806 average)** was the most expensive. Frequency does not necessarily align with treatment cost.

- **Cancer Treatment:**  
  Despite being the **least costly on average ($25,162)**, **cancer** remained among the top conditions in frequency ‚Äî possibly reflecting high efficiency or optimized oncology protocols.

- **Test Results:**  
  The dataset shows nearly equal distribution of test results: **Abnormal (18,627)**, **Normal (18,517)**, and **Inconclusive (18,356)** ‚Äî suggesting diagnostic variability or ambiguity.

- **Insurance Spread:**  
  Insurance was distributed almost evenly across providers, with **Cigna** slightly leading at **11,249** cases ‚Äî pointing to a competitive insurance market.

- **Hospital Billing:**  
  Average billing among top hospitals ranged narrowly between **$51,976 and $52,373**, indicating standardized billing procedures.

- **Blood Type Distribution:**  
  All blood types appeared relatively balanced, with **A- (6,969)** being the most common ‚Äî suggesting a genetically diverse patient base with no significant outliers.

## ‚úÖ Recommendations

- Implement cost-efficiency programs targeted at **obesity-related treatments**, which account for the highest average billing.  
- Prioritize **early diagnosis and management** of arthritis and diabetes to reduce long-term costs.  
- Re-evaluate **diagnostic procedures or lab technologies** due to high inconclusive result rates.  
- Renegotiate **insurance terms** using provider performance data and market saturation as leverage.  
- Maintain **standardized billing** while reviewing performance metrics across facilities.  
- Apply **oncology best practices** to other high-cost conditions due to its cost-effectiveness.  
- Integrate **blood type and demographic intelligence** into personalized care models.

## üìå Conclusion

The Stellacare Multi-Year Healthcare Report reveals consistent trends in billing, prevalent chronic conditions, and test result distributions. Key opportunities lie in addressing high-cost conditions like obesity, improving diagnostic accuracy, and leveraging insurer diversity for better negotiations. These insights offer a clear path for Stellacare to enhance operational efficiency, reduce patient care costs, and deliver more targeted, proactive healthcare services.
